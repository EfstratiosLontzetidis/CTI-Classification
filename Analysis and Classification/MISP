STEP 5 CLASSIFICATION

5.1 Contents of Source:
select distinct(type)
from MISP_STIX2
Results: Indicator, Identity, Marking Definition, Relationship, Observed Data, Vulnerability, Report

Percentages of SDO's,SRO's
In place of indicator also  Identity, Marking Definition, Relationship, Observed Data, Vulnerability, Report
select count(*)
from MISP_STIX2
where type = "indicator"
Results: Indicators 68850 (83,34%), Identities 13 (0,01%), Relationships 2362 (2,85%), Marking Definitions 269 (0,32%), Observed Data 10924 (13,22%), Vulnerabilities 46 (0,05%), Report 140 (0,16%)

Search specific SDO,SRO
In place of indicator also  Identity, Marking Definition, Relationship, Observed Data, Vulnerability, Report
select *
from MISP_STIX2
where type = "indicator"

5.2 Cyber Kill Chain :
Kill chain phases names
select distinct(kill_chain_phases.phase_name)
from MISP_STIX2
Results: file, Network activity, Payload installation, Payload delivery, External analysis, Artifacts dropped

How many CTIPs included CKC fields: 68850 (83,34%)
select count(*)
from MISP_STIX2
where kill_chain_phases.phase_name in ('file','Network activity','Payload installation','External analysis', 'Artifacts dropped','Payload delivery');

Search specific kill chain phase name (in place of network activity could be : file, Payload installation, Payload delivery, External analysis, Artifacts dropped)
select *
from MISP_STIX2
where kill_chain_phases.phase_name = 'Network activity'

Percentages of kill_chain_phases:(in place of network activity could be : Network activity, Payload installation, Payload delivery, External analysis, Artifacts dropped)
select count(*)
from MISP_STIX2
where kill_chain_phases.phase_name = 'file'
Results: file 2362 (3,43%), Network activity 29855 (43,36%), Payload installation 6455 (9,37%), Payload delivery 23319 (33,86%), External analysis 2427 (3,52%), Artifacts dropped 4432 (6,43%)
