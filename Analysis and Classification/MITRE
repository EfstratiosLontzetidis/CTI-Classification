STEP 5 CLASSIFICATION

5.1 Contents of Source:
select distinct(type)
from MITRE_STIX2;
Results: Tool, Course of action, Intrusion set, Identity, Attack pattern, Relationship, Marking Definition, Malware

Percentages of SDO's,SRO's,SCO'S
In place of identity also  Tool, Course of action, Intrusion set, Attack pattern, Relationship, Marking Definition, Malware
select count(*)
from MITRE_STIX2
where type = "identity"
Results: Identity 4 (0,03%), Course of Action 330 (2,57%), Intrusion set 131 (1,02%), Malware 471 (3,67%), Attack pattern 1029 (8,02%), Marking definition 4 (0,03%), Relationship 10789 (84,13%), Tool 66 (0,51%)

Search specific SDO,SRO
In place of identity also  Tool, Course of action, Intrusion set, Attack pattern, Relationship, Marking Definition, Malware, X MITRE MATRIX, X MITRE TACTIC
select *
from MITRE_STIX2
where type = "identity"

5.2 Cyber Kill Chain :

select count(*),kill_chain_phases.phase_name
from MITRE_STIX2
group by kill_chain_phases.phase_name
order by kill_chain_phases.phase_name desc;
**88 phase names, output omitted.

How many CTIPs included CKC fields: 883 (6,88%)
select count(*)
from MITRE_STIX2
where kill_chain_phases.phase_name like "%%";

Search specific kill chain phase name (in place of technical-information-gathering could be other 87 names)
select *
from MITRE_STIX2
where kill_chain_phases.phase_name = 'technical-information-gathering'
